This is the repository of the submitted paper "Distortion Discriminator Helps Improve Speech Restoration" for Signal Processing Letters, created on 2024/12/24. 

In this repository, we release the sample waveforms we used as test set in the paper, as well as results processed by proposed models. 

We also open-source the code we used for training, which describes the proposed Distortion Discriminator and other details.
